TransitionGroup ​&lt;TransitionGroup&gt; is a built-in component designed for animating the insertion, removal, and order change of elements or components that are rendered in a list.Differences from &lt;Transition&gt; ` {#differences-from-transition}&quot;">​&lt;TransitionGroup&gt; supports the same props, CSS transition classes, and JavaScript hook listeners as &lt;Transition&gt;, with the following differences:By default, it doesn't render a wrapper element. But you can specify an element to be rendered with the tag prop.Transition modes are not available, because we are no longer alternating between mutually exclusive elements.Elements inside are always required to have a unique key attribute.CSS transition classes will be applied to individual elements in the list, not to the group / container itself.TIPWhen used in DOM templates, it should be referenced as &lt;transition-group&gt;.Enter / Leave Transitions ​Here is an example of applying enter / leave transitions to a v-for list using &lt;TransitionGroup&gt;:template&lt;TransitionGroup name="list" tag="ul"&gt;
  &lt;li v-for="item in items" :key="item"&gt;
    {{ item }}
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/TransitionGroup&gt;
css.list-enter-active,
.list-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
.list-enter-from,
.list-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(30px);
}
Add at random indexRemove at random index12345Move Transitions ​The above demo has some obvious flaws: when an item is inserted or removed, its surrounding items instantly "jump" into place instead of moving smoothly. We can fix this by adding a few additional CSS rules:css.list-move, /* apply transition to moving elements */
.list-enter-active,
.list-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s ease;
}

.list-enter-from,
.list-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(30px);
}

/* ensure leaving items are taken out of layout flow so that moving
   animations can be calculated correctly. */
.list-leave-active {
  position: absolute;
}
Now it looks much better - even animating smoothly when the whole list is shuffled:AddRemoveShuffle12345Full ExampleStaggering List Transitions ​By communicating with JavaScript transitions through data attributes, it's also possible to stagger transitions in a list. First, we render the index of an item as a data attribute on the DOM element:template&lt;TransitionGroup
  tag="ul"
  :css="false"
  @before-enter="onBeforeEnter"
  @enter="onEnter"
  @leave="onLeave"
&gt;
  &lt;li
    v-for="(item, index) in computedList"
    :key="item.msg"
    :data-index="index"
  &gt;
    {{ item.msg }}
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/TransitionGroup&gt;
Then, in JavaScript hooks, we animate the element with a delay based on the data attribute. This example is using the GreenSock library to perform the animation:jsfunction onEnter(el, done) {
  gsap.to(el, {
    opacity: 1,
    height: '1.6em',
    delay: el.dataset.index * 0.15,
    onComplete: done
  })
}
