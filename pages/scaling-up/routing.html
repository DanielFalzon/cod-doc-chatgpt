Routing ​Client-Side vs. Server-Side Routing ​Routing on the server side means the server sending a response based on the URL path that the user is visiting. When we click on a link in a traditional server-rendered web app, the browser receives an HTML response from the server and reloads the entire page with the new HTML.In a Single-Page Application (SPA), however, the client-side JavaScript can intercept the navigation, dynamically fetch new data, and update the current page without full page reloads. This typically results in a more snappy user experience, especially for use cases that are more like actual "applications", where the user is expected to perform many interactions over a long period of time.In such SPAs, the "routing" is done on the client side, in the browser. A client-side router is responsible for managing the application's rendered view using browser APIs such as History API or the hashchange event.Official Router ​ Watch a Free Video Course on Vue School Vue is well-suited for building SPAs. For most SPAs, it's recommended to use the officially-supported Vue Router library. For more details, see Vue Router's documentation.Simple Routing from Scratch ​If you only need very simple routing and do not wish to involve a full-featured router library, you can do so with Dynamic Components and update the current component state by listening to browser hashchange events or using the History API.Here's a bare-bone example:vue&lt;script setup&gt;
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import Home from './Home.vue'
import About from './About.vue'
import NotFound from './NotFound.vue'

const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}

const currentPath = ref(window.location.hash)

window.addEventListener('hashchange', () =&gt; {
  currentPath.value = window.location.hash
})

const currentView = computed(() =&gt; {
  return routes[currentPath.value.slice(1) || '/'] || NotFound
})
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;a href="#/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a href="#/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a href="#/non-existent-path"&gt;Broken Link&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;component :is="currentView" /&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
Try it in the Playgroundvue&lt;script&gt;
import Home from './Home.vue'
import About from './About.vue'
import NotFound from './NotFound.vue'

const routes = {
  '/': Home,
  '/about': About
}

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      currentPath: window.location.hash
    }
  },
  computed: {
    currentView() {
      return routes[this.currentPath.slice(1) || '/'] || NotFound
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    window.addEventListener('hashchange', () =&gt; {
		  this.currentPath = window.location.hash
		})
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;a href="#/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a href="#/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a href="#/non-existent-path"&gt;Broken Link&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;component :is="currentView" /&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
