Conditional Rendering â€‹Watch a free video lesson on Vue SchoolWatch a free video lesson on Vue Schoolv-if â€‹The directive v-if is used to conditionally render a block. The block will only be rendered if the directive's expression returns a truthy value.template&lt;h1 v-if="awesome"&gt;Vue is awesome!&lt;/h1&gt;
v-else â€‹You can use the v-else directive to indicate an "else block" for v-if:template&lt;button @click="awesome = !awesome"&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;h1 v-if="awesome"&gt;Vue is awesome!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 v-else&gt;Oh no ðŸ˜¢&lt;/h1&gt;
ToggleVue is awesome!Try it in the PlaygroundTry it in the PlaygroundA v-else element must immediately follow a v-if or a v-else-if element - otherwise it will not be recognized.v-else-if â€‹The v-else-if, as the name suggests, serves as an "else if block" for v-if. It can also be chained multiple times:template&lt;div v-if="type === 'A'"&gt;
  A
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div v-else-if="type === 'B'"&gt;
  B
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div v-else-if="type === 'C'"&gt;
  C
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div v-else&gt;
  Not A/B/C
&lt;/div&gt;
Similar to v-else, a v-else-if element must immediately follow a v-if or a v-else-if element.v-if on &lt;template&gt; ` {#v-if-on-template}&quot;">â€‹Because v-if is a directive, it has to be attached to a single element. But what if we want to toggle more than one element? In this case we can use v-if on a &lt;template&gt; element, which serves as an invisible wrapper. The final rendered result will not include the &lt;template&gt; element.template&lt;template v-if="ok"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
v-else and v-else-if can also be used on &lt;template&gt;.v-show â€‹Another option for conditionally displaying an element is the v-show directive. The usage is largely the same:template&lt;h1 v-show="ok"&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
The difference is that an element with v-show will always be rendered and remain in the DOM; v-show only toggles the display CSS property of the element.v-show doesn't support the &lt;template&gt; element, nor does it work with v-else.v-if vs. v-show â€‹v-if is "real" conditional rendering because it ensures that event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are properly destroyed and re-created during toggles.v-if is also lazy: if the condition is false on initial render, it will not do anything - the conditional block won't be rendered until the condition becomes true for the first time.In comparison, v-show is much simpler - the element is always rendered regardless of initial condition, with CSS-based toggling.Generally speaking, v-if has higher toggle costs while v-show has higher initial render costs. So prefer v-show if you need to toggle something very often, and prefer v-if if the condition is unlikely to change at runtime.v-if with v-for â€‹NoteIt's not recommended to use v-if and v-for on the same element due to implicit precedence. Refer to style guide for details.When v-if and v-for are both used on the same element, v-if will be evaluated first. See the list rendering guide for details.Edit this page on GitHub
